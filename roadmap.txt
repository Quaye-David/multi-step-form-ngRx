Set up the Project:

Create an Angular project with TypeScript.
Configure the project structure, including components, services, and routing.
Establish a design system based on the provided design elements and color properties.


Implement the Starter Page:

Create a component for the starter page.
Add a signup link that navigates to the multi-step signup form.
Ensure the starter page is visually consistent with the design.


Develop the Multi-Step Signup Form:

Create separate components for each step (Your Info, Select Plan, Add-Ons, Summary).
Implement form validation to prevent submission until all required fields are filled.
Allow users to jump between steps by clicking on the step names, except for mobile users.
Preserve form data during navigation between steps.


Manage Form Data:

Use a service to handle form data management across the multi-step form.
Implement data persistence mechanisms to avoid data loss on browser refresh.


Implement Navigation and Routing:

Set up routing to handle navigation between the starter page and the multi-step signup form.
Ensure the "Next Step" button only allows progression when all required fields are filled.


Implement the Reset Feature:

Create a button or link to allow users to reset the form and start the signup process over.
Clear the form data and navigate back to the starter page.


Handle Incomplete Signup:

If a user starts the signup process but doesn't finish, redirect them to the starter page.
Pre-fill the personal information fields with the saved data when they return to the multi-step form.


Successful Signup Redirection:

After successful form submission, redirect the user to the starter page or a custom success page.


Unit Testing:

Write unit tests for the utility functions used in the implementation.


Final Touches:

Ensure the application is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Perform thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix any issues.
Document the project structure, design decisions, and implementation details.
